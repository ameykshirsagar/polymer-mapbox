Mapbox Elements for Polymer 3

This is a rewrite of [mapbox-gl](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerVis/mapbox-gl) library which was originally written for Polymer v2. However to make it work on Polymer v3, I had to port the library to Polymer v3 conventions. There could be certain bugs in this library and a pull request or any suggestion is most welcome

Cheers!!!


## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) and npm (packaged with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)) installed. Run `npm install` to install your element's dependencies, then run `polymer serve` to serve your element locally.

## Viewing Your Element

```
$ polymer serve
```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run your application's test suite locally.
